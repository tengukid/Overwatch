    <h3>Overwatch's doctors and scientists were stumped, and Tracer's case seemed hopeless until Winston designed the
        chronal accelerator, a device capable of keeping Tracer anchored in the present. In addition, it gave Tracer the
        ability to control her own time, allowing her to speed it up and slow it down at will. With her newfound skills,
        she became one of Overwatch's most effective agents.

        Tracer’s first mission took place in London, where she and her team successfully halted the Null Sector forces
        involved in the King’s Row uprising. It was the start of a stellar career: she would go on to help apprehend a
        valuable contact of Talon, Maximilien, in Havana. With the lead Maximilien had given them, Tracer’s strike team
        then put Talon’s leader, Doomfist, behind bars.</h3>
