            <p class="tag">Overwatch (retroactively referred to as Overwatch ) was a 2016 team-based multiplayer
                first-person
                shooter game by Blizzard Entertainment.The game was first released for PlayStation 4, Windows,
                and
                Xbox
                One
                in May 2016 and Nintendo Switch in October 2019. Cross-platform play was supported across all
                platforms.
            </p>
        </div>

        <p class="tag">Described as a "hero shooter", Overwatch assigned players into two teams of six, with
            each
            player
            selecting
            from a large roster of characters, known as "heroes", with unique abilities. Teams worked to
            complete
            map-specific objectives within a limited period of time. Blizzard added new characters, maps,
            and
            game
            modes
            post-release, all free of charge, with the only additional cost to players being optional loot
            boxes
            to
            purchase cosmetic items.
        </p>

        <p class="tag">A sequel, Overwatch 2, was announced in 2019 and entered beta in 2022.
            The game is free to play, with all cosmetic items from Overwatch carried over while introducing
            new
            heroes,
            maps, and gamemodes.
            On October 3, 2022, the Overwatch servers were shut down in preparation for the release of
            Overwatch
            2
            the
            next day.</p>

        <h2><u>Plot</u></h2>
        <p>Overwatch is set sixty years into the future of a fictionalized Earth, thirty years after the
            resolution of
            what
            is known as the "Omnic Crisis."
            Before the Omnic Crisis, humanity had been in a golden age of prosperity and technology development.
            Humans developed robots with artificial intelligence called "Omnics", which were put to use to
            achieve
            economic
            equality, and began to be treated as people in their own right. The Omnic Crisis began when the
            worldwide
            automated "omnium" facilities that produced them started producing a series of lethal, hostile
            robots
            that
            attacked humankind. After individual nations' efforts failed to ward off the Omnics, the United
            Nations
            quickly
            formed Overwatch, an international task force designed to combat this threat and restore order.
