        <center>Equal parts brilliant and controversial, scientist Moira O'Deorain is on the cutting edge of genetic
            engineering,
            searching for a way to rewrite the fundamental building blocks of life.

            Over a decade ago, O'Deorain made waves when she published a controversial paper detailing a methodology for
            creating custom genetic programs that could alter DNA at a cellular level. It seemed like a promising step
            toward overcoming diseases and disorders and maximizing human potential.

            Dissent among her peers soon followed. Many considered her work to be dangerous because of its perceived
            ethical
            shortfalls, and O'Deorain was even accused of having the same unchecked desire for scientific advancement
            that
            some believed had caused the Omnic Crisis. In addition, other geneticists were unable to reproduce the
            results
            of O’Deorain’s research, which further called her discoveries into question. Instead of kickstarting her
            career,
            her paper seriously damaged her reputation.</center>
