    <h3>But his life was thrown into chaos when the other gorillas led an uprising, killed the mission scientists, and
        claimed the colony for their own. Taking on the name of his beloved human caretaker, Winston built a makeshift
        rocket and escaped the base. Unbeknownst to him, Specimen 8—a hamster Winston had befriended named Hammond—had
        hitched a ride to Earth with him. While Hammond landed in Australia and settled among the Junkers, Winston found
        a new home with Overwatch, an organization that represented everything he had come to admire about humanity.
        Winston was finally able to live up to the heroic ideal that had been instilled in him.

        At Overwatch, Winston developed the chronal accelerator technology that anchored Tracer to the present. He,
        Tracer, and Genji graduated from agent training together and, together, assisted in apprehending first
        Maximilien and then the leader of Talon himself, Doomfist. When Overwatch fell, Winston was distraught and went
        into seclusion, longing for the golden days of heroism to return.</h3>
